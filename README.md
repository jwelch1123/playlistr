# Playlistr

Given a message, this program uses the Spotify API to assemble a playlist of track titles matching the message and saves it to your Spotify page. 

## Operation:

First, this program uses dotenv to get the ID and Secret provided by Spotify. Using the Python requests package these are sent to Spotify's API to receive an Access Token which is used to return search results. 

Your message is then passed to several functions which use a sliding and decreasing window to search for matching songs. So we might look for words 1->3, then 1->2, 1 alone, followed by 2->4, 2->3, 2 alone, etc. Whether a matching track is found or not a tuple of the start and end index are returned as a dictionary key along with None or the song information. 

After all combinations have been accessed for a match, the program uses the start and end indexes to create a chain of titles representing your message. For instance, we might have found matching tracks for the 1st word, 2nd-3rd, 4th to 6th, etc. These titles need to be joined without missing or repeated words. This can be thought of as a graph network with the nodes representing the junction (or space) between two words in the message, the edges are the track titles that connect the space before the first word in a track and the space after the last word in the track. I implement a recursive search (depth first) to find a path from the first to last nodes (words in the message). If a path isn't found the last word and an error message are displayed.

To add the playlist to a user's profile access is needed via the [PCKE method](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow). The user is prompted to follow a link and permit access to their username, and ability to edit playlists. They are redirected to a localhost link which is copied and pasted into the command line. 

Finally, the user provides a title and description for the playlist created via Spotify's API. Tracks are added to the playlist along with a cover image and the link is displayed to the user. 


## Usage:

I am currently working on a web-app version of this app, in the meantime to run it locally:

1. Follow [this guide from Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started) to register your own app and obtain credentials. 
2. Download the repo and install the requirements file, `pip install requirements.txt` 
3. In the directory of `playlistr.py` create a `.env` file and add two lines for the client id and client secret provided by Spotify for your app. 
    > client_id='abcdedcba'
    >
    > client_secret='secret'

4. The program can be invoked from the command line. If it successfully creates the message, a link will be provided to allow access to your Spotify account. 
    - Permissions Used: View username, Create and Edit playlist. 
5. After allowing permissions the page will redirect to `localhost:8080`, and copy the complete URL back into the command line. 
6. Provide a playlist name and description.


## Known Issues:
- Commonly the tracks found can not be assembled into a phrase that matches yours. This is either due to words in your message not being found in the returned tracks or multiple tracks not lining up correctly. Rephrasing your message can help, the program will return the last word it was able to assemble but doesn't differentiate between these two failure modes.
- Very common short words such as "the", "a", "are" have a low chance of returning as a single-word track title. They are usually part of a multi-word track title which should factor into your decision on how to construct your message. 
- Searching through the Spotify API appears to return different track results compared to searching via the app. This may lead to tracks not being found by this program but can easily be identified by a search. Increasing the "search_rounds" of the "match_phrase" function may help.
